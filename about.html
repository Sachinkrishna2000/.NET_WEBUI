<h2>About Us</h2>

<p>Coursera was launched in 2012 by two Stanford Computer Science
professors, Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller, with a mission to provide
universal access to world-class learning.

It is now one of the largest online learning platforms in the
world, with 102 million registered learners as of March 31, 2022.
Coursera partners with over 250 leading university and industry
partners to offer a broad catalog of content and credentials, including
courses, Specializations, Professional Certificates, Guided Projects, and
bachelor’s and master’s degrees.

Institutions around the world use Coursera to upskill and reskill
their employees, citizens, and students in fields such as data science,
technology, and business. Coursera became a B Corp in February 2021.

<h2>What We Believe</h2>
<div class="borderradius">
<pre>
Learning is the source of human progress.

It has the power to transform our world
from illness to health,
from poverty to prosperity,
from conflict to peace.

It has the power to transform our lives
for ourselves,
for our families,

for our communities.

No matter who we are or where we are,
learning empowers us to change and grow
and redefine what’s possible.
That’s why access to the best learning is a right, not a

privilege.

And that’s why Coursera is here.
We partner with the best institutions
to bring the best learning
to every corner of the world.

So that anyone, anywhere has the power to
transform their life through learning.
